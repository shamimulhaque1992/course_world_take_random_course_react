### About The Website
In this website i've implemented some basic react cocept like react hook, state, prop, component, etc. When a user will visit the website they will first see some course, which were managed by some fake json data and. User also can add some of those course and can pic some random course. There is an clear button as well to clear the cart. At last there is a portion in the site where i've discussed some basic react question and answer. Hope you like my work and appreciate it.
